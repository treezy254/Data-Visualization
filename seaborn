Trends : A trend is defined as a pattern of change
	sns.lineplot - Line charts are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group.


Relationship : There are many different chart types that can be used to understand relationships between variables in a dataset

	sns.barplot		: useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups

	sns.heatmap		: Heatmaps can be used to find color coded patterns in tables of numbers

	sns.scatterplot	: show relationship netween two continous varibales

	sns.regplot		: including a regression line in the scatterplot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables

	sns.lmplot		: This command is useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatter plot contains multiple,color-coded groups.

	sns.swarmplot	: Categorical scatter plots show the relationship between a continous varibale and a categorical variable


Distribution: We visualize distributions to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a varibale, along with how likely tehy are.

	sns.histplot	: show distribution of a single numerical variable

	sns.kdeplot		: show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable

	sns.jointplot	: useful for simulataneously displaying a 2D KDE plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable
